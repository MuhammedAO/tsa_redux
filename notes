The overall idea and purpose of redux is that in react, managing a large components that needs access to state becomes very difficult and it gets very messy and that's where redux comes in.

With redux, instead of component level state, you get App level state.

You have your view(Component) and then you have your Store which includes your state and then it sends down the state to your component.

inside of your component, you might have a button clicked which will fire off an Action/Action creator which will dispatch an action to the store.

You also have reducers which are pure functions that specifies how the app level state should change in response to an action. and then the reducers respond with a new state.
